# Portfolio

This repository contains the projects I have developed to date, showcasing my skills and knowledge in software engineering and related fields.

## Projects

### Metaheuristics Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)  
Developed as part of a university course on Metaheuristics, this project tackles the classic Traveling Salesman Problem involving up to 16,512 cities. It implements and compares several algorithmic approaches, including Greedy algorithms, Local Search, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithms. A significant part of the project is dedicated to the study and evaluation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) systems, analyzing their effectiveness and performance compared to other metaheuristics for solving large-scale TSP instances.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project: Ideological Division in Social Media Posts  
This project applies NLP techniques to analyze ideological polarization in posts from the social media platform X. It involves collecting and preprocessing large datasets of textual data, performing sentiment and thematic analysis, and developing classification models to identify and categorize ideological stances. The project highlights challenges related to language variability and social context, aiming to provide insights into how ideological divisions manifest in online discourse.
